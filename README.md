## Best Practices

### General Git Practices
1. **Write Clear Commit Messages**
   - Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
   - Include a concise summary and, if needed, a detailed explanation in the body.

2. **Commit Often but Meaningfully**
   - Avoid large, monolithic commits. Break changes into smaller, logical commits.

3. **Use `.gitignore` Effectively**
   - Exclude files like logs, temporary files, and sensitive information (e.g., API keys).

4. **Keep Your Repository Clean**
   - Remove unused branches and keep the repository well-organized.

5. **Pull Before Push**
   - Always pull the latest changes from the remote branch before pushing.

### Branching Strategies
1. **Use Descriptive Branch Names**
   - Examples: `feature/add-user-login`, `bugfix/fix-header`, `hotfix/crash-on-startup`.

2. **Adopt a Branching Model**
   - **Git Flow**: Use `master`, `develop`, `feature`, `release`, and `hotfix` branches.
   - **GitHub Flow**: Use a single `main` branch with feature branches for new work.

3. **Rebase or Merge Strategically**
   - Use rebasing for keeping a clean commit history.
   - Use merging when working collaboratively to preserve history.

4. **Review Before Merging**
   - Use pull requests and code reviews to ensure code quality.
